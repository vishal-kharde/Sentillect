Campaign 2016 Trump: Make America Great Again Trump: Make America Great Again Location: United States North Carolina Font Size: mediumlargemaximum Print Share The American Presidency Project Promote Your Page Too It great Charlotte discuss issue means much me. That issue urban renewal, rebuilding inner cities. Today I want talk grow African-American middle class, provide new deal Black America. That deal grounded three promises: safe communities, great education, high-paying jobs. My vision rests principle defined campaign: America First. Every African-American citizen country entitled government puts jobs, wages security first. I'm asking today honor vote, privilege represent President. Here promise I make you: whether vote not, I greatest champion. I special interest, I take orders donors lobbyists – I work you, you. Our campaign change, optimism, future. I asking people break bitter failures past, imagine amazing possibilities future. Our opponent represents rigged system failed thinking yesterday. Her campaign offers depressing pessimism says good gets, nothing ever really change. Hillary 30 years hasn't fixed anything – she's made worse. American politics caught time loop – keep electing people, keep making mistakes, keep offering excuses. The fact corrupt Washington establishment tried hard stop movement proof represent kind change arrives lifetime. Every day I'm trail proposing fresh solutions new thinking. And every day, people, getting rich broken system, tell us can't change can't try anything new. I message doubters Washington: America's future belongs dreamers, cynics. And it's time extend dream every African-American citizen country. African-American citizens sacrificed much nation. They fought died every war since Revolution, pews picket lines lifted conscience country long march Civil Rights. Yet, many African-Americans left behind. 45% African-American children age 6 live poverty. 58% African-American youth currently employed. African-Americans compromise roughly 13 percent population, yet make-up 60% murder victims age 22. In 2015, violent crime Charlotte increased 18 percent – it's expected rise 24% 2016. In city Chicago, nearly 3,500 people shot since January year. The conditions inner cities today unacceptable. The Democrats run inner cities fifty, sixty, seventy years more. They've run school boards, city councils, mayor's offices, congressional seats. Their policies failed, they've failed miserably. They've trapped children failing government schools, opposed school choice every turn. The Clintons gave us NAFTA China's entry World Trade Organization, two deals de-industrialized America, uprooted industry, stripped bare towns like Detroit Baltimore inner cities North Carolina. This state lost nearly half manufacturing jobs since Bill Hillary's NAFTA, decimating African-American middle class. Democratic policies also given rise crippling crime violence. Then issue taxation regulation. Massive taxes, massive regulation small business, radical restrictions American energy, driven jobs opportunities inner cities. Hillary wants raise taxes successful small businesses high 45 percent – drive jobs community, countries. One greatest betrayals issue immigration. Illegal immigration violates civil rights African-Americans. No group economically-harmed decades illegal immigration low-income African-American workers. Hillary's pledge enact "open borders," – made secret foreign bank – would destroy African-American middle class. At center revitalization plan issue trade. Massive, chronic trade deficits emptied jobs. Just look happened Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, right North Carolina. It's greatest jobs theft history world. If I'm President, executives Ford Motor Company announce moving plants jobs Mexico, I pick phone make simple call. I tell executives move factories Mexico, I put 35% tax product ship back United States. We won't let jobs stolen anymore. When stop offshoring low-wage countries, raise wages home – meaning rent bills become instantly affordable. At time, plan lower business tax 35 percent 15 percent bring thousands new companies onto shores. It also includes massive middle class tax cut, tax-free childcare savings accounts, childcare tax deductions credits. I also propose tax holidays inner-city investment, new tax incentives get foreign companies relocate blighted American neighborhoods. I empower cities states seek federal disaster designation blighted communities order initiate rebuilding vital infrastructure, demolition abandoned properties, increased presence law enforcement. I also pursue financial reforms make easier young African-Americans get credit pursue dreams business create jobs communities. Dodd-Frank disaster, making harder small businesses get credit need. The policies Clintons brought us financial recession – lifting Glass-Steagall, pushing subprime lending, blocking reforms Fannie Freddie. It's time 21st century Glass Steagall and, part that, priority helping African-American businesses get credit need. We also encourage small-business creation allowing social welfare workers convert poverty assistance repayable forgive-able micro-loans. Then issue public safety. Making communities safe priority Trump Administration. I heard listened concerns raised African-American citizens justice system, I promise Trump Administration law applied fairly, equally without prejudice. There one set rules – two-tiered system justice. The best evidence unequal justice Hillary Clinton could violate many laws, bleach delete 33,000 emails Congressional subpoena, lie Congress FBI – put national security grave risk – even face much fine. Equal justice also means rules Wall Street. The Obama Administration never held Wall Street accountable. We also police streets. I want every poor African-American child able walk street peace. Safety civil right. The problem presence police absence police. I invest training funding local federal law enforcement operations remove gang members, drug dealers, criminal cartels neighborhoods. The reduction crime merely goal – necessity. We get done. The war police urged rival reckless, dangerous, puts African-American lives risk. We must work police, them. On immigration, policy simple. I restore civil rights African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Americans, ending illegal immigration. I reform visa rules give American workers preference jobs, I suspend reckless refugee admissions terror-prone regions cost taxpayers hundreds billions dollars. A portion money saved enforcing laws, suspending refugees, re-invested inner cities. It time help American citizens become refugees country. Infrastructure another major goal. My contract calls $1 trillion dollars infrastructure investment, inner cities major beneficiary. I also cancel wasteful climate change spending Obama-Clinton, including global warming payments United Nations. These steps save $100 billion 8 years, money used help rebuild vital infrastructure, including water systems, America's inner cities. School choice center plan. My proposal redirects education spending allow every disadvantaged child America attend public, private, charter, magnet, religious home school choice. School choice great civil rights issue time, I nation's biggest cheerleader school choice 50 states. I also appoint commission investigate school prison pipeline shut create new pathway leads great education great job. My plan also ensure funding Historical Black Colleges Universities, affordable 2 4-year college, support trade vocational education. Finally, today, agenda includes protection religious liberty, promotion family, support African-American church. This beginning. Because I never, ever take African-American community granted. It mission prove country yesterday tomorrow. The cycle poverty broken, great new things happen people. But achieve future, must reject failed elites Washington who've wrong virtually everything decades. The people opposing us promised passing NAFTA, opening markets China, would bring new era prosperity job creation. Instead, brought poverty heartache. The people opposing us people who've wasted $6 trillion wars Middle East produced terrorism, death, suffering – imagine money spent home. My opponent unleashed ISIS world. She tried build Democracy Libya, failed. She tried build Democracy Iraq, failed. She tried regime change Egypt, failed. She pressed regime change Syria, failed. She tried Russian Reset failed. She tried Asia Pivot failed. Now, Hillary Clinton wants confront nuclear-armed Russia shooting war Syria could lead us World War III. Finally, opponents passed healthcare law, embraced Hillary Clinton, furious objections American voter. Obamacare destroying healthcare system – premiums skyrocketing double-digits surging 100% great state Arizona. Doctors quitting, insurers leaving, companies fleeing. Every prediction made law lie. If don't repeal replace disastrous law, lose healthcare system forever. Now time embrace New Direction. I've lucky led great life. Now I want give back country good me. I left hotel Pennsylvania Avenue Washington D.C., delivered budget, ahead schedule, creating thousands jobs, including construction. It one finest hotels anywhere world, great symbol country. I took two hours fly Washington, cut ribbon children, jump plane you. I wanted children, worked hard hotel -- parents must stick with, encourage, support children. They great job hotel, I told so. Likewise, workers magnificent job -- without them, could never built quickly beautifully. The rebuilding Old Post Office rebuilding I want country. I want go inner cities, poor rural communities, failing schools, I want work national plan revitalization. I'm tired excuses politicians. I'm tired told can't done. I'm tired people asking Americans defer dreams another day, really another decade. Enough waiting. The time now. There nothing can't accomplish. There task project great. There dream outside reach. Everywhere I go country, I see untapped potential waiting set free. But never realize potential continue putting faith broken political system let us time again. We choose optimistic path – choose believe politicians, believe country. If that, anything possible. I'm asking America join dreaming big bold things future. Let's close history books failures Washington, let's open new chapter success prosperity everyone. I humbled beyond words nominee Party Abraham Lincoln. And highest greatest hope Republican Party home African-American vote again. Together, government of, people. And Make America Great Again For All Americans.
